Type Promotion:
smaller datatype is promoted to bigger one if no matching data type is found
E.g: add(int a, Long b)
When we call add(4,5) then 5 is promoted to long data type,
But if
Actual Agruments - add(4,5)
1. matches Formal arguments add(int a, int b)
    4 and 5 matched to a and b

2. Doesnt match but can be promoted
   add(int a, Long b)
   4 matched to a but 5 is promoted to Long

3. Matches more than once/ ambiguity
   add(int a, Long b)
   add(Long a, int b)
   who to promote to long is ambiguity
