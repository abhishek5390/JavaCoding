We cannot reduce the visibility of the inherited method from Parent
When parent class method is public, we cannot change the access modifier of child class to private, protected or default. This will throw Compile time error
Solution: 
1. Change the visibility of inherited class to public.
2. Change the visibility of parent class method and inherited method to package. I mean dont specify any access modifiers to both the methods

You can make inherited method more accesible than the parent class method. 
ex: default to parent class method and public for inherited method
hierarchy -> public, protected, default (no keyword has to be specified), private
This is how restricted visibility of overriden method is not allowed
