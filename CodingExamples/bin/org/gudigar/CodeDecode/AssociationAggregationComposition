Association - relationships between 2 classes
Types of Association

Aggregation - HAS-A relationship. is a weak association. Which means 2 objects are loosely coupled, and one object can exist without the other object also

Car HAS-A driver
driver HAS-A car

public class Driver{
     private Car car;
}
