Imagine that the Java language lacked an implementation of the LinkedList concept. Write your own Java implementation of LinkedList (for integers) as follows:
•        The list should be singly linked (i.e. navigable from Head to Tail and not vice-versa)
•        You may *not* use any Java Collections or Arrays in your solution
•        The class should provide:
o   A constructor taking no arguments (i.e. an empty list)
o   A constructor taking an integer argument (i.e. the first member of the list)
o   A method ‘getSize’ returning the number of items in the list
o   A method ‘insertSorted’ taking an integer argument that inserts this integer at a position in the LinkedList based on ascending numerical value, where the Head holds the smallest integer and Tail holds the greatest integer
Implementation notes
•        The solution will be evaluated for correctness, good OO design and clean/elegant code
